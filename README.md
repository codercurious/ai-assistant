Introducing our Apify actor that empowers your dataset with the magic of AI! This tool takes the data you already have and, with a help of AI, amplifies it to give you more insights, possibilities, and actions.

## How Does It Work?
1. Feed in your dataset.
2. For every row or item, our actor communicates with the AI, guided by your special prompts or instructions.
